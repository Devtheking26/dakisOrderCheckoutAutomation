# How to use DakisOrderCheckout.py


1. Open Dakis and make sure there are no popup windows.
2. Open Accuterm and get it to the default screen.
3. Wait until Get and AutoCheck on the Dakis Job Downloader software are not greyed out.
4. Start the checkout automation software.
5. Follow the prompts in the program window.
6. Scan in all order numbers. **Only use the Order ID barcode or Bag Number**
7. When finished scanning in the orders type n and press enter.
8. Watch the orders get checked out.

The program will check out dakis first then any accuterm orders

**Note: It is very possible weird things will happen if you scan something wrong**
